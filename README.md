# Why:
Running an off-chain relayer for cross-chain applications built on wormhole is no easy task. There are multiple things you need to juggle simultaneously: 
- ensuring **every vaa** is redeemed
- managing contract interfaces across ecosystems
- securely providing funds to pay for relaying
- mantaining relay-protocol contracts configuration up to date
- many, many more...

This gets particularly difficult when you need to run many production grade relayers, like we do at [xLabs](https://xlabs.xyz/).

Enter **Kamaji**, an engine to run and service an ***ecosystem of relayers***.

# What:
## High Level Architecture:
This relay-engine is modeled "service registry" where clients can register their needs to be serviced. As such there are two main roles to distinguish:
- Clients: Mmainly Relayers and Oracles. The engine focuses on simplifying the spawning and management of this components with minimal code, making it easy to spawn dozens if not hundreds of reliable, predictable, observable relayers.
- Services: Components purposed to assist clients in performing their tasks by managing all the environment related complexity (rpc pools, wallets, security, pnl tracking, error handling, monitoring, alerting).

This aims to abstract away environment complexity out of a relayer, with two main purposes:
- Allowing the relayer to focus only on the business logic
- Reusing all infrastructure related code. (TODO: link quote to why)

### Client Components:

- **Relayer:** Clients that perform relay. They can be uniquely identified by an ID provided. This ID will be used to login against keycloak This id will have a KMS role associated with it, which will determine what wallets the relayer can use, and how it can use them.
- **Oracle Tasks:** Worker running contract update tasks when this is required.

### Service Components:

- **Kamaji:** Acts as a gateway to orchestrate all relay-related services
- **VAA Stream Registry:** Registers relayers interested in VAA streams and the status of those VAAs.
- **Vaa Scanner:** Uses as many sources as possible to keep the relayers in the VAA stream registry as up-to-date as possible with the VAAs signed.
- **Key Cloak:** Authorization service that allows a relayer to assume a KMS role
- **KMS:** Key management system. Contains a set of roles, each of which has access to certain actions over certain wallets
- **Accountant:** Keeps track of the cost and benefit of operations relayed.
- **Oracle:** Takes care of monitoring block-chains to provide hooks for oracle-tasks


# Components:

## Relayer:

A relayer can be considered a lambda function that needs to be serviced with:

- A stream of VAAs for certain emitter combinations (emitter addresses + emitter chains)
- Funds to pay for the relays
- Monitoring of the outcome of the VAAs processed including its economic result.

In a fully automated relay engine, starting a relayer would require:

- Registering a list of emitters to listen to
- Registering a list of chains wallets will be needed for
- Registering a function that can parse the body of a VAA
- Registering a function that can route a VAA to a queue
- Registering a function that given a VAA and a wallet pool, knows how to use the wallets in the pool to redeem the VAA
- Registering a function that given a VAA and its RelayTx knows how to recover the fee charged for relaying that VAA

```tsx

type RelayTx {}; // represents the cost of a tx.
type RelayFee {};
type VAA { id, hash, bytes };
type QueueDescriptor { name, arn };

abstract class Relayer<VaaFormat> {
	emitters: EmitterFilter[]
	targets: SupportedChain[]
	parseVaa(vaa: VAA): VaaFormat {} // maybe we don't need to enforce this one :thinking:
	route(vaa: VaaFormat): QueueDescriptor {}
	handle(vaa: VaaFormat): RelayTx[] {}
	calculateReceivedFee(vaa: VaaFormat, relayTxs: RelayTx[]): RelayFee {}
}
```

With this simple six properties interface, Kamaji could service a relayer to help it go through the entire life-cycle of a relay, by:

- Hooking to VAA streams and forwarding them to the appropriate queue
- Providing the relayer with a wallet pool that always contains necessary funds
- Providing the relayer with an RPC pool that always contains healthy RPCs
- Monitoring and broadcasting the result of VAA execution, including its economic results

### Relayer Bootstrap:

Relayer will send Kamaji and declare the resources it needs to be served with, and Kamaji will create, update or delete resources as needed.

1. Kamaji will authenticate the relayer and get its KMS role.
2. Relayer will send a manifest:
    1. emitter combinations itâ€™s interested in
    2. chains it will operate on
    
    Using this data, Kamaji will:
    
    1. Verify that VAA Stream Registry is up to date with the relayer requirements
    2. Verify that the KMS role has the wallets required by the relayer. If some wallet is not available it can create it along with its alert.
    3. Return to the relayer the list of wallets it might use for each chain, along with a list of  the most current RPCs
3. Relayer will use the wallets and rpcs returned in the step above to instantiate wallet-manger and start waiting for VAAs
4. Relayer will start a worker that reads from the pertinent queues.

### Relayer Operations:

1. VAA Streamer will use the stream registry to stay up to date on the VAA for those emitters using as many sources as possible (initially spy and missed-vaa v4)
2. When a VAA is detected for an emitter, VAA streamer will call the `route()` method to understand what queue the vaa should be routed to. Upon success, it'll forward the vaa to such queue.
3. If the call to `route()` repeatedly fails, VAA streamer can mark the VAA as stuck and trigger an alert
4. **Relayer** will process the VAA and post its results to a new **topic** so that they can be post processed by interested parties, such as recording the atomic pnl, recording the vaa status in the vaa-stream-registry or gathering specific metrics.
